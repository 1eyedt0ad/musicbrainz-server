If this is an existing install you'd like to update, please run:

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server.git
    git fetch --prune origin

and then proceed with whatever update process you were using, presumably either
'git pull' or 'git checkout {tag}' for some tag.
